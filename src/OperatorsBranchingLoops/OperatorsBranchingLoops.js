// I did it somehow, first of all I did third statement in every if else but it wasn't working then I checked by logging it that if the for loop is working or not. Then I saw it was working and then I did that array[j]= "something" and boom, I got it.

// Question4: Write a program to return a Fibonacci series : 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

// const fibonacci = (a = 0, b = 1) => {
//   if (a === 0 && b === 0) {
//     return console.log("Can't return a Fibonacci series.");
//   } else console.log("calculating...");
//   // trying to figure out
// };
// // fibonacci(0, 1);

// Question5: Write a program to take an input from a user and find its Factorial.

// const factorial = (a) => {
//   for (let i = 0; i < a; i++) {
//     let x = a;
//     function multiply() {

//     }
//     multiply();
//   }
// };

// I came up with this solution. As of now it has worked fine. But now I think I need to google for other solutions, what if there is a better way.
